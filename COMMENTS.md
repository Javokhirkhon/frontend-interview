### Task Summary

All tasks have been completed as expected, with the exception of the tests. Due to time constraints, I was unable to write comprehensive tests. However, the following has been accomplished:

- **Data Fetching & Pagination**: Implemented the feature to fetch applications data from the API with pagination, loading, and error states. The "Load More" button fetches 5 new applications each time and handles errors gracefully.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: The application is fully responsive and works well on mobile devices.
- **Backend to Frontend Type Export**: Types from the backend server have been exported to the frontend for better usability and type safety.
